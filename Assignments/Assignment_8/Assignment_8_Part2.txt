#Assignment_8_PART2
Upload responses to the following as a numbered plaintext document to Canvas:
1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.

Yes, especially for those predictions that deal with Nitrogen. I consider that this is because the model computes all possibilities and in the real world, this type of model is not very realistic.

2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.

Yes. I used geom_density() to carry out some analyses. I looked up some explanations in the following link:
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/09/fitting-polynomial-regression-in-r/

3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

nonlinearData <- read_csv("../../Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")
names(nonlinearData)
model <- lm(response ~ poly(predictor), data= nonlinearData)
summary(model)

ggplot(nonlinearData, aes(x=predictor, y=response))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+
  stat_smooth(method=lm, formula = y ~ poly(x,5, raw=TRUE))
